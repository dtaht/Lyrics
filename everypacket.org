I'm an computer hacker
ever since my shell was bourne
building a glorious network
that's mostly used for porn

and the one thing they say about hackers is
the'll take you as soon as your packet storm

You don't have to be a 6 footer
but you do have to have a good brain
You don't have to have to have any clothes on
And I'm not the one you should blame

Because... 

Every packet's sacred
none should ever stray
Every packet's valued
by our SLA

Every packet's sacred
Every packet's great
If a packet is wasted
The network loses state

Every packet's sacred
Every packet's great
If a packet' wasted
The network loses state

Every packet's sacred 

Every packet is sacred.
Every packet is great.
If a packet is wasted,
TCP gets quite irate.

Let the heathen drop theirs
When their RAM is spent.
Their SLA's make them pay for
Each packet that can't be sent.

Every packet is wanted.
To this we are sworn.
From real-time data from CERN
To the filthiest of porn.

RIAA, Studios, Lawyers,
Want to block yours any time,
But Vint loves those who treat
google's packets as sublime.
